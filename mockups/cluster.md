## Design notes  

### Confidence Charts  

Some outcomes of an informal meeting we had the 5th of February:  
* The *Cluster Quality* charts will be renamed to *Confidence Charts* or something in this line.  
* There will be two charts of this kind:  
  * Peptide Ratio vs Precursor MZ plot (scatterplot or series of boxplots). We will have here a distribution of how confidently each MZ range is represented in the cluster.    
  * Peptide Ratio vs Spectrum similarity plot (scatterplot or series of boxplots). Similarly here we will have a distribution of spectrum similarities accorss the MZ range for a given cluster.    
* For PSMs, a tabular section will be used where each row will present:  
  * the peptide sequence  
  * modifications  
  * number of PSM  
  * and number of species
